NB: About A/C codes: In AircraftTypes, one set of codes is always 3 characters while the other is varying in length (usually 4)
	- They are simply named description and designator
		- Not sure if they match with codes but they look familiar
	
A/C Typecode (iata?)
	- Code
		- Nb. May be strange / generic like "BALL" or "DISC"
			- May also be more specific like AT43 (which would match with iata code?)

	- Engine number
	- Model name(s): String (opt)
		- In equipment.dat, there are listed iata (3 letter) codes + their model names (which usually contain manufacturer name)
			- It is unclear whether this information should be used / where the name should be applied
			(since an iata code may be associated with multiple models)
			- It is probably best to read this document last and just make sure the specified iata codes are stored in database 
			and have some name associated with them. Other documents should be preferred.

		although documentation says that they are from IATA. Research more into this.
	- Iata code: 2 letter string (opt)

		- There are manufacturer names in common, but not separated in columns
		- Syntax seems to be:
			- 1) "1 x " / "2 x " / "" (engine count, opt)
