ICAO Engine Types (Order_7360)
	- E = Electric
	- P = Piston
		- Creates rotational motion by using pistons (pressure)
			- Whereas jet/turbine engines use combustion from fuel
	- T = Turboprop/Turboshaft
		- Power plant is a gas turbine
		- Deliver shaft power as output
	- J = Jet
		- Jet engines are airbreathing engines which provide thrust by jet propulsion
		- This definition includes turbo-jets and turbo-fans
		- When contrasted to turboprop/turboshaft, this probably refers to turbojet/turbofan
	- R = Rocket
		- Difference to turbine/airbreathing jet is that this type of engine doesn't need air intake
		- Are usually used for only short whiles
	- C (extra?) = Fixed wing aircraft with two engines coupled to drive a single propeller system
		- May be considered a turboprop (?)

ACREF / ENGINE Engine Types
	- 0 - None
	- 1 - Reciprocating
		- Same as piston
	- 2 - Turbo-prop
		- Output is utilized by a propeller
	- 3 - Turbo-shaft
		- Output is used to power a shaft to run a rotor or shaft
		- Primarily used in helicopters
	- 4 - Turbo-jet
		- Base model
	- 5 - Turbo-fan
		- Incorporates a fan
	- 6 - Ramjet
		- An airbreathing jet engine that creates more speed when there is air intake
		- Used in missiles, for example
		- Can't be used from standstill
	- 7 - 2 Cycle
		- A piston-based engine
	- 8 - 4 Cycle
		- A piston-based engine
	- 9 – Unknown
	- 10 – Electric
	- 11 - Rotary
		- Old-school engine which rotates
